# FigSass Smart Contract

```python
Project name: FigSass Smart Contract
```

This project involves converting Figma JSON variables to a SCSS variable structure. A smart contract will be implemented to automate the conversion of a Figma variable JSON export into the relevant list of variables and place them into a SCSS file.

## The Algorithm

1. Set-up Python environment.
   1. Check the and update the installed Python version.
   2. requisites: Homebrew: <https://brew.sh/> - installed with `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)`
2. FigSass Smart Contract **algorithm:**
   1. Read the Figma JSON file using a python data object
   2. Export data into a file with extension .scss
